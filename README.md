# hello-world
My first repository, created using the time-honoured "hello world" approach to doing something new.
Since I'm following a tutorial, I should probably do what it asks me to do, which is to write something about me.
Well, I'm a human, born to parents, both human, about 375 years ago. I'm not sure if all of that is true, but some of it is, which is probably good enough.
